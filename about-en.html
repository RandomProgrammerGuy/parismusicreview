            <h1 class="title">The origins of Paris Music Review</h1>
            <p class="text">Paris Music Review was created in June 2024 by Parsa Farjam. Our objective is to be a truly neutral music review platform that is uninfluenced by commercial success, artist fame or monetary interests. In a world where major music awards often only pick the most reknown artists, and where some music reviewers get paid to praise certain releases, PMR lets the music speak for itself.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Our Methodology</h1>
            <p class="text">Paris music review rates albums and songs based on the following criteria:</p>
            <ul class="text">
                <li>Musicality</li>
                <li>Lyrical Value</li>
                <li>Vocal Technique and Style</li>
                <li>Uniqueness</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">Every song or album will get graded out of 5 on all of the above-mentioned criteria, and these points will be added up to give the album or song a total grade out of 20.</p>
            <p class="text">The "Musicality" grade represents two aspects of the music: the production and the music theory used. To get 5.00/5.00 on Musicality, a song or album has to present a complex production that is well-thought-out, meaningful, and norm-breaking; or take advantage of advanced music theory tools and experiment with the limits of what is musically possible. Needless to say, if an album or song accomplishes both at the same time, it will be well-graded. However, points may be reduced if the record is not well mixed/mastered, or if the complexity of the music gets in the way of the listener's enjoyment. For albums, cohesion (meaning the way songs relate to one another) is also taken into account. Albums whose songs sound "too similar" or "too different" will be penalized</p>
            <p class="text">The "Lyrical Value" grade represents the songwriting of the album or song. To get 5.00/5.00 on Lyrical Value, a record has to be very well-written, with lyrics that encourage contemplation and deliver deep meanings. The use of advanced grammar, vocabulary and literary styles, as well as unique song topics are encouraged.</p>
            <p class="text">The "Vocal Technique and Style" grade represents the singer's ability to effectively express the lyrics of the record in question. To get 5.00/5.00 on Vocal Technique and Style, an artist must posess a highly-developed voice, with clear and effective vocal training and a wide vocal range. The vocal style of the artist must match the backing track and the lyrics of the song. It is possible for an artist to get a high grade while using digital technologies such as pitch shifting, but the artist must not be reliant on said tools to sing well. A stylistic use of digital technologies is not penalized. Effective harmonization is also taken into account in this grade.</p>
            <p class="text">The "Uniqueness" grade represents the originality of a song or album. To get 5.00/5.00 on Uniqueness, an album or song must be unlike previously made music, successfully taking risks and stepping outside of the "musical comfort zone". Unique song arrangements, unexpected changes throughout a song or album and other novel and creative elements are valued.</p>
            <p class="text">It is important to note that a perfect grade is quite rarely given by PMR in any of the categories. Most "normal" pop songs and albums will get an overall score between 12.00/20.00 to 14.00/20.00. Any album or song that gets above a 16.00/20.00 can be considered as a great record, and scores equal to or above 18.00/20.00 are reserved for truly exceptional records.</p>
            <p class="text">This methodology is made to fit the majority of Pop, Alternative, Rock/Metal, Indie, Electronic and Jazz music. However, some genres such as Hip-Hop/Rap and Classical/Neo-Classical cannot be fairly judged by this methodology, and therefore these genres are not currently rated by PMR. We are designing methodologies taylor-made for these genres, but until then we will not be rating records from these genres. Also, these methodologies, once developed, will not be directly comparable to records rated with the main methodology.</p>
            <p class="text">As a final note, when we rate albums, the rating includes any deluxe versions, extended edits, etc.</p>
